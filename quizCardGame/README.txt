QuizCard is a digital version of flashcards we used to memorize things in school. First a question is presented then the answer is shown. The User must first run the QuizCardBuilder program first. This allows the user to enter the questions and corresponding answers then save the set of cards. Then the user can run the QuizPlayer program and open the set of cards they have saved.
